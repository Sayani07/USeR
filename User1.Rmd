#Challenges??

--

_**Collectively, all this data has the potential to create vast opportunities to analyze and make meaningful insights**_


- User needs to insert a query in the website every time to obtain information about performance of a player

- Limited ways to save those tables efficiently for comprehensive comparison of two or more players and facilitate statistical thinking in cricket

#Package Cricketdata 

##Opening door to more data driven stories for men's and women's cricket

---
# Package - [CricketData](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/cricketdata)

Contains scraper functions for downloading data from ESPNCricinfo into tibbles which can be readily used to analyse the performance of players across different game formats and activities


_**fetch_cricinfo**_ : Innings/Career wise summary of the players for all countries (*Existed Before*)

_**find_player_id**_ : Obtain the player id when the user types the name (may be partial) of the player

_**fetch_player**_ : Obtain the performance of a player in different formats like TESTS, ODI or T20 and different activities like batting, fielding and bowling using the player id obtained from *find_player_id*

# Question

###How does Average score change with increasing Duck Rate amongst players with similar high scores?

###How high score increases / decreases with increase in Duck Rate amonst players with similar average scores

 - Can this plot be used to identify how players with similar average scores are different from each other in terms of consistent performance

Ducks: Explain
