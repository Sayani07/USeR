#Challenges??

class: left,left

###Collectively, all this data has the potential to create vast opportunities in statistical thinking in cricket


&lt;span style="color:green"&gt; User needs to insert **FIVE** (approx) queries on the website to obtain information about performance of **ONE** player  &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span style="color:brown"&gt;Limited ways to save those tables efficiently for **comprehensive comparison** of two or more players &lt;/span&gt;

##Opening door to more data driven stories for men's and women's cricket

# Package - [CricketData](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/cricketdata)

Contains scraper functions for downloading data from ESPNCricinfo into tibbles which can be readily used to analyse the performance of players across different game formats and activities


&lt;span style="color:MediumVioletRed"&gt;**fetch_cricinfo** &lt;/span&gt;    
To fetch Innings/Career summaries of the players for all countries  


&lt;span style="color:MediumVioletRed"&gt;**find_player_id**&lt;/span&gt;  
To fetch player id when the user types the name (may be partial) of the player  

&lt;span style="color:MediumVioletRed"&gt;**fetch_player_data**&lt;/span&gt;  
To obtain the performance of a player in different formats like TESTS, ODI or T20 and different activities like batting, fielding and bowling using the player id obtained from *find_player_id*
